        Thought experiments make it obvious that this idea is memetic, and just
        has not been tried in the market. Once one initial company opens up this
        model, many more will follow and copy:

        For the same price as a Louie Vuitton bag, a permanent shelter can be
        built in Bangladesh for a family in need. This gives rise to the idea
        that anytime someone walks into a designer store and purchased an item,
        they are having to burn down a house (most making this decision
        unknowingly).
      </p>
      <p className="text-[1.6rem] mb-[1rem]">
        Based on the principle “if a penny saved is a penny earned” we can
        extrapolate that to a Louie bag is a home burned. But just telling
        someone not to flex is not going to solve the problem. If we really want
        to win this war, we just need to sell higher status, for the same price.

        Imagine trying to connect with a luxury purse buyer as protestors
        outside of a designer store. Rather than simply protesting their
        spending on that good, we need to sell them a better version of what
        they are buying.

        Protests outside of stores that sell meat where stands are set up
        showing customers videos of the harmed animals may not be a great way to
        connect with the target audience, and often cause a greater divide in
        mindsets.
      </p>
      <p className="text-[1.6rem] mb-[1rem]">
        In this case volunteers or employees could stand outside of luxury goods
        markets, sporting the aligned luxury merch. Rodeo drive for example is a
        notorious spot where every designer store not only has a shop, but
        theres a steady flow of customers.

        Social media accounts devoted to making content here are already
        massively viral amassing hundreds of millions of views interviewing
        buyers. Each successful conversion, would make for a viral video and an
        ad set, bringing potentially thousands of new customers while
        kickstarting educating the world of the low status of wasteful spending
        now that a better alternative exists.
