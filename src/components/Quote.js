        “Over the past hundred years we have increase the global GDP sevenfold,
        yet wealth inequality continues to skyrocket and luxury spending grows
        rapidly. In order to change the failure of redistribution of wealth at
        scale, we must effectively influence culture and help redefine what
        “status” is in the modern age. This will ultimately change the flow of
        money in society as the new age of status being helping the world,
        becomes more prominent. We have failed at building a society which
        healthily distributes wealth/power. Given society is a collective
        project we are responsible for, we think this stems from the culture not
        supporting doing good as the highest form of status. We have more than
        enough resources, but many people without access to them, and a culture
        that motivates and glorifies overspending on vanity luxury goods.” -
