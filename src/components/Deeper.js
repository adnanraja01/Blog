          On a fundamental level once someone gets the basics covered as in
          food, water, shelter. They can start to spend their time and money on
          convenience, health, and purpose but more often than not; status is
          where a majority of surplus wealth goes.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-[1rem]">
          Societally we lack an alignment of our status symbols with creating a
          better world and with bettering ourselves. This idea to change what we
          cultural see as status has been referred to as
          <span className="font-medium"> “Status Engineering” </span> .
        </p>
        <p className="mb-[1rem]">
          What we wear is the most direct way we have to represent ourselves and
          our ideals/values. What your role model wears, or any person of
          influence is shaping the idea of status in that child, teenager, or
          adults mind.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-[1rem] font-medium">
          Status is what we are buying when we pay $1, $10, or even $500 extra
          for a certain brand of T-Shirt irrespective of comfort.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-[1rem] ">
          The problem is not that buying status is a failure mode of an
          individual. Status is a form of positive competitive drive in society
          and a tool for respect attribution. That’s why you see Dior shoes in
          economy. This is not a miscalculation, currently the status from
          spending $1100 on shoes does have more long term value than things
          like first class because we are playing the game of unenlightened
          capitalism.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-[1rem]">
          The problem is that we support the status symbol which costs $1100 and
          does no good for humanity. Thus this expenditure is not a failure of
          the buyer who bought status, it is only misguided that we do not have
          designer shoes that cost $1100, which builds a literal house in
          Bangladesh (a small home can be built as a permanent structure for
          someone for this amount). We need higher forms of status to exist in
          order to progress our culture which will aid in the distribution of
          wealth and power on a systemic level.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-[1rem]">
          Once higher status objects are unveiled will these purely financial
          status seems become recognized for their tackiness and buying status
          will coincide with doing good. With no better alternative currently,
          we idolize symbols of wealth. Thus, on our highest display of who we
          are, the clothing we wear, we display 0 creativity or care for the
          world in spending and instead promote wasting wealth for the sake of
          power/leverage over others, and then we wonder why society is
          misaligned to building a healthy world. Fashion, what we wear, is the
          biggest signal we have in representing our identity and values.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-[1rem]">
          If we can provide a better representation of status in clothing we can
          not only change the money used to buy status into doing good for the
          world, but we can change our core representation of status in society
          towards doing good.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the larger belief is that this systemic change is the real
          impact in realigning our culture towards true status, the amount of
          funds in status spending that could be redirected towards positive
          causes is also no joke.
